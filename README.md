# Memory OS — Hermes Agent Memory Operating System

![Memory OS Banner](assets/banner.jpg)

> **Your agent finally stops forgetting.**  \
> Permanent memory. Local memory infrastructure. API-provider agnostic. Surgically token-efficient.

Seven memory layers. Automatic, intelligent context injection. Structured facts with trust scoring. A self-curating wiki pipeline. Semantic search across **every conversation you've ever had**.

Memory OS turns Hermes Agent into a real long-term collaborator — one that remembers your projects, your decisions, your reasoning, and brings exactly the right context back at exactly the right moment. Like talking to a colleague who was there for every session.

**Memory infrastructure runs entirely on your machine. Works with any LLM provider — OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or local models. No memory subscription. No vendor lock-in.**

## The problem every serious Hermes user knows

You spend hours configuring the agent, teaching it your preferences, solving hard problems together — and in the next session it acts like it's meeting you for the first time.

- Repeating context at the start of every conversation
- Losing the thread of important decisions made weeks ago
- Structured facts — your stack, your projects, your patterns — with nowhere to live
- Every memory solution you've tried is either cloud-locked or too shallow to matter

After months of hitting these walls in production, I built something that actually works.

## What Memory OS is

Not just another plugin. A complete **memory operating system** — 7 layers working in concert, from flat files to a vector database, with surgical context injection, a knowledge pipeline that organizes itself, **and an explicit Ground Truth hierarchy that tells the agent to actually use the injected memory**.

Designed and refined by someone who ran headfirst into every limitation of stock Hermes and every existing memory solution.

**Requirements:** Hermes Agent + Qdrant + Redis + ARQ Worker + Python 3.11+ (all run natively on Windows — no Docker or WSL needed).  
Compatible with any LLM provider Hermes supports — OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and more.

After a reboot on Windows, run `start.bat` from the repo root to bring up the native local runtime: Redis, Qdrant, Ollama embeddings, llama.cpp chat, and the ARQ worker.

To launch Hermes with Memory OS available, run `start-hermes.bat`. It syncs the Icarus Hermes plugin, starts the local Memory OS runtime, then launches `hermes`.

`llama.cpp` is part of the Memory OS local runtime here. Hermes' primary chat model remains whatever you configure in Hermes itself; Memory OS connects through the Icarus plugin hooks and tools.

## Architecture: 7 memory layers

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How it flows:**

`pre_llm_call` → surgical recall from all four sources (Fabric + Qdrant + Sessions + Facts)

**But recall is not enough.** The agent must be explicitly instructed to treat this injected context as authoritative. That's what [Layer 7](layers/07-ground-truth.md) provides — without it, the agent rediscovers knowledge that's already in the prompt.

`post_llm_call` + `on_session_end` → automatic learning extraction and capture

Each source is gated by relevance thresholds. Per-session deduplication prevents the same context from appearing twice. A social-closer filter skips trivial messages entirely. No padding. No firehose. The LLM gets exactly what it needs — nothing more.

---

## Why Layer 7 is the most important layer

Layers 1-6 ensure memory is **captured, stored, and injected**. Layer 7 ensures the injected memory is **used**.

Without the Ground Truth hierarchy:
- Qdrant points are injected but the agent calls the Qdrant API to verify them
- Fabric entries are injected but the agent runs `fabric_recall` to re-find them  
- Session history is injected but the agent runs `session_search` to re-discover it
- Facts are injected but the agent probes `fact_store` to confirm them

The result: **memory-zero behavior** despite perfect injection. Every rediscovery burns tokens, context, and time.

→ **[Read Layer 7: Ground Truth Hierarchy](layers/07-ground-truth.md)** — the critical fix.

## Memory OS vs. stock Hermes

| Aspect | Stock Hermes | Memory OS |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace memory | MEMORY.md + USER.md | + CREATIVE.md + intelligent injection |
| Session memory | Basic state.db | + FTS5 full-text search + session injection |
| Structured facts | Not present | Fact store + trust scoring + feedback loop |
| Cross-session recall | Limited | Fabric fork + multi-source injection |
| Vector search | Not present | Qdrant hybrid + 4-level fallback cascade |
| Cleanup and deduplication | Not present | Decay scanner + semantic dedup + archival |
| Knowledge pipeline | Not present | Self-curating LLM Wiki |
| **Ground Truth hierarchy** | **Not present** | **Injected memory ranked as authoritative; agent must use context provided** |
| Token efficiency | — | Surgical: gated retrieval + per-session dedup + no wasted rediscovery |
| Infrastructure | — | Local memory stack (Qdrant + Redis + ARQ) + any LLM provider |

---

## Why not mem0, Zep, Letta, or other providers?

Because almost every modern memory solution is **cloud-first**. If you want real, private memory infrastructure running on your own machine — with no cloud memory subscription, full provider flexibility, and no data leaving your local stack — none of them deliver what Memory OS delivers.

| | Memory OS | mem0 | Zep | Letta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local memory infrastructure | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| No memory subscription | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Provider agnostic (OpenRouter, Ollama…) | ✓ | Partial | Partial | Partial |
| Hermes-native | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Structured facts + trust scores | ✓ | Partial | ✗ | ✗ |
| Self-curating wiki | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Intelligent decay + archival | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Ground Truth hierarchy** | **✓** | **✗** | **✗** | **✗** |

## Included components

- **Icarus Plugin (heavily modified fork)** — bundled in `icarus/`  
  The upstream [esaradev/icarus-plugin](https://github.com/esaradev/icarus-plugin) is the base, but this fork is not upstream-compatible. Key additions: LLM-powered session extraction (replaces `text[:500]` truncation), multi-source injection (Qdrant + sessions + facts — upstream is fabric only), CREATIVE.md isolation (fixes `§` delimiter corruption from dual-writer conflict), backtick sanitization, system injection filter, and social closer detection.

- **Vault Curator v3** — [ClaudioDrews/vault-curator](https://github.com/ClaudioDrews/vault-curator)  
  Frontmatter enrichment, semantic linking, and MOC index generation for the wiki layer.

## Who this is for

For people who take Hermes Agent seriously.  
For people who want an agent that **actually evolves** over time — one that doesn't need the world re-explained every session.  
For people who value clean engineering, extreme efficiency, and solutions that hold up in real local production.

If you're like me — tired of amnesiac agents — Memory OS was built for you.
